# Task-1: Assignment

### Background

Since you have completed the learning phase, it is time to implement some basic commands. 

### Important
 - You can refer to the cheat sheet in this folder for any command references, if required.
 - We recommend to **NOT** use generative AI tools for the assignments, except in the learning phase, if you need clarifications. Task 1 assignments themselves are not very difficult. We will allow you to use generative AI if and when required.
 - Please update your progress on the progress sheet once you complete the assignment.
 - For any clarifications, please contact the us. We will be happy to answer.
 - Deadline for the assignment will be informed on the WhatsApp group.
 
### Assignment 1-A

Make sure your local Git and GitHub accounts are connected.

- Clone this repo. Make sure it is visible on your Github, and should be synced with your local copy.
- Once you have a clone of the repo in your account, create a new folder under the Task1 directory, and put files of your choice in it.
- Commit changes.
- Write a markdown file listing what you did, commands you run and link to your cloned repository with the changes you made.
- Make sure your documentation is detailed. Maybe add a little info about the commands themselves you ran.

### Assignment 1-B

-   Create a **new branch** named `task1-branch`

-   In that branch:
    -   Add a new markdown file `task1.md`.
    -   Write: What are branches, why are they useful.
-   Commit the changes.
-   Push the branch to GitHub.
-   Create a Pull Request to merge `task1-branch` into `main`.
-   Merge the Pull Request.
-   Pull the updated `main` branch to local.


> Please note, as stipulated, we need you to write the markdown explaining your work. You have already learnt markdown files from the learning phase of this task.

Upon completion of the task, update it in the excel sheet provided on the group.
